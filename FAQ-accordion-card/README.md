## My process

###  ✅ Built with

</br>

###  ✅ What I learned
- I implemented the mobile version using media queries. 
- In JavaScript, I used querySelectorAll to select elements and traversed them using forEach.

</br>

###  ✅ Continued development
- I learned about the difference between forEach and the actions performed on the currently clicked elements.
